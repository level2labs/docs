## How Premium Credits Work

When you have Premium credits available in your account, our system will automatically use them for your generations. This means you don't need to manually switch between credit types - the system handles this optimization for you.

### Automatic Upgrade Process

1. System checks for available Premium credits
2. If Premium credits are available, they are automatically used
3. If no Premium credits are available, the system falls back to standard credits

## Premium vs Standard Credits

| Feature | Premium Credits | Standard Credits |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| AI Models | Advanced | Standard |
