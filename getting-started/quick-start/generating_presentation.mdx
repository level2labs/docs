## Tips & Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: The more detailed your instructions, the more tailored the output.
- **Provide Context**: Including background information helps the AI align the content with your objectives.
- **Use Reference Materials**: Uploading relevant files can enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated content.
- **Consider Visual Elements**: The AI will automatically create appropriate layouts and suggest visual elements for each slide.
- **Iterate as Needed**: If the first draft isn't perfect, refine your instructions and regenerate.
