## Tips & Best Practices

- **Be Specific About Structure**: Clearly define the layout, columns, and rows you need.
- **Specify Formulas**: Mention any specific calculations or formulas you want included.
- **Define Data Types**: Indicate the type of data (numbers, text, dates) for each column.
- **Include Formatting Requirements**: Mention any specific formatting needs (currency, percentages, etc.).
- **Use Reference Materials**: Uploading existing spreadsheets can help the AI understand your preferred structure and calculations.
- **Iterate as Needed**: If the first draft isn't perfect, refine your instructions and regenerate.

By following these best practices, you can save time, reduce manual spreadsheet creation, and consistently generate well-structured, formula-rich spreadsheets.
